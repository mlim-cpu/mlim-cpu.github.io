      Fatima spends the majority of her online time on her phone. She said she is embarassed at the amount of screentime she has logged on it. She wants to change her morning routines where she doesn't start her day off on her phone. Her primary app for communication with family and friends is whatsapp. She has spent a lot of time recently on Netflix engrossed in a new series.
