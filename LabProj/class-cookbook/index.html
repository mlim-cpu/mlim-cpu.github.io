<h1 class="title">Quick Russian Dill Pickles</h1>
<p>
<h2 id="instructions">Ingredients<h2>
<ul>
<li>4 cups water
<li>1.5 tablespoons sea salt (see note)</li>
<li>2 pounds small bumpy cucumbers (see note)</li>
<li>1 head garlic</li>
<li>60 g fresh horseradish root (optional)</li>
<li>4-6 flowering dill heads</li>
<li>4-6 black currant leaves (optional)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions<h2>
<ol>
<li>Boil 4 cups of water and dissolve 1.5 tablespoons of sea salt in the water. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Wash the cucumbers.</li>
<li>Optionally: trim the ends off. I don't usually do that.</li>
<li>Peel the garlic. Cut bigger garlic cloves in half.</li>
<li>If using, cut about 2 inches off the fresh horseradish root (about 60 g). Peel using a potato peeler. Cut into small pieces similar to the size of garlic cloves.</li>
<li>In a clean 1.5 litre jar, lay a couple flowering dill heads, a couple black currant leaves, if using, drop a few pieces of garlic and horseradish. Add the cucumbers standing vertically.</li>
<li>Add a couple more flowering dills, black currant leaves, a few pieces of garlic and horseradish and another layer of cucumbers.</li>
<li>Scatter the rest of the cloves and horseradish around and cover the cucumbers with the remaining flowering dill and black currant leaves.</li>
<li>Pour the brine over the cucumbers making sure that all the ingredients are fully covered.</li>
<li>Place the jar on a plate to catch spills if the jar is very full.</li>
<li>Cover the jar with cheesecloth and keep on the counter to ferment for 48 hours.</li>
<li>After 48 hours the brine will start turning cloudy and there will be a bit of foam at the top. It is exactly what you are looking for. It does NOT mean that there's anything wrong. The pickles are NOT spoiled.</li>
<li>The Low-Salted Quick Russian Dill Pickles are now ready to eat. Cover the jar with a lid and keep in the fridge for 7 to 10 days.</li>
